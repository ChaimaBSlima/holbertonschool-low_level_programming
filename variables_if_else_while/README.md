# C - Variables, if, else, while

As a holberton school student I built this directory named variables_if_else_while to more exercise C variables,loops and conditions.

## Files

| Files |  Description                |
| :-------- |  :------------------------- |
| `0-positive_or_negative.c` | contain a program that assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. |
|  `1-last_digit.c` |contain a program that assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. |
| `2-print_alphabet.c` | contain a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.(only use the putchar function twice)  |
| `3-print_alphabets.c` | contain a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.(only use the putchar function 3 times) |
|`4-print_alphabt.c` |contain a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except q and e followed by a new line.(only use the putchar function twice) |
| `5-print_numbers.c` | contain a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| `6-print_numberz.c` |contain a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.(only use the putchar function twice) |
| `7-print_tebahpla.c` | contain a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. |
|` 8-print_base16.c` |contain  a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.(only use the putchar function 3 times)|
| `9-print_comb.c`| contain a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.(only use the putchar function 4 times) |
