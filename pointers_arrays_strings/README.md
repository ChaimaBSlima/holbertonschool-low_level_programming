# C - More functions, more nested loops

As a holberton school student I built this directory named pointers_arrays_strings to  exercise C pointers arrays and strings

## Common Files 

| Files |  Description                |
| :-------- |  :------------------------- |
| `main.h` | it's a header file that contain the prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar.|
| `_putchar.c`| contain the function _putchar created by holberton. |

## Files of Project 1
| Files |  Description                |

| `1-swap.c`| contain a function that swaps the values of two integers. |
| `2-strlen.c` |contain  a function that returns the length of a string.|
| `3-puts.c` | contain a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. |
| `4-print_rev.c` | contain  a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. |
|`5-rev_string.c` | contain a function that reverses a string.|
| `6-puts2.c` | contain  a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. |
| `7-puts_half.c` |contain  a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. |
| `8-print_array.c` | contain  a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.|
|` 9-strcpy.c` |contain   a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.|
| `100-atoi.c`| contain a function that convert a string to an integer. |

## Files of Project 2
| Files |  Description                |
| :-------- |  :------------------------- |
