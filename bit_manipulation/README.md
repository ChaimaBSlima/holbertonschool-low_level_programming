# C - Bit manipulation
As a holberton school student I built this directory named bit_manipulation to manipulate bits and bitwise operators.
## Files

|  `0-binary_to_uint.c` |contain a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. |
| `1-print_binary.c` | contain a function that prints the binary representation of a number. |
| `2-get_bit.c` | contain a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. |
|`3-set_bit.c` |contain a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.|
|`4-clear_bit.c` |contain a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.|
| `5-flip_bits.c` |contain a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.|
