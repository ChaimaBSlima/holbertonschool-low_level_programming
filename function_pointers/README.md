# C - Function pointers

As a holberton school student I built this directory named function_pointers to exercice C functions and pointers.

## Files
 All codes use recursion

| Files |  Description                |

| `function_pointers.h` | it's a header file that contain the prototypes of all the functions.|
| `0-print_name.c` |contain a function that prints a name. |
| `1-array_iterator.c` | contain  a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. |
| `2-int_index.c` | contain  a function that searches for an integer. |

### Task 3 : a program that performs simple operations.

| Files |  Description                |

| ` 3-op_functions.c` | contain the 5  functions that perform the 5 operations (addition, subtraction,  multiplication,  division,  modulo) |
